It reflects that something that is not interested to the students is happening in the school or the school does not provide the love, belongingness and safety to them as like their home.<br><br>
If the teacher is unsuccessful, then for most children, school life means
Most irritating moment – morning alarm
Most difficult task – to find socks
Most dreadful journey – way to class
Most lovely time – meeting friends and playing with friends
Most tragic moments – surprise test in the1st period
Most wonderful news – Teacher is absent
<br>
Most schools offer students variety of courses that they can choose from, but the majority of students don’t have any ideas of what they might be interested in and what they should pursue in future life. They can’t blindly predict what they would enjoy until they have enough information. Confused students can get help<br><br><br>

      <h3>TEACHERS’ ROLE</h3><br>
          Teachers act as the guides and guardians to guide them on the right path. In school, teachers try to remove the evils from the students by sowing some seeds of good qualities in them.Teacher is the   second parent to a child and their responsibility at school is in no way lesser than the mother   at home.However, teachers try to teach their students to think critically by encouraging them to ask questions like “Why do I think that”, “What would happen if...”, or “How are these two things   different” before doing any projects or learning any new subjects.

      <h3>STUDENTS</h3><br>
         Thinking in a critical way, evaluating and understanding the relationship among the problem give a person a new perspective to look at the problem differently in order to solve it.   Learning to communicate effectively with others is another skill  which is taught to the students. Doing presentation is a very common and good example for building students’ communication skills. Almost every   subject in secondary school requires presentations, and as a result,   the students learn how   to communicate with peers through discussions and gathering information.
